*After installation, Anchor Components will appear in the app palette on the right side (Cmd-Opt-P).*

### Usage

Select a component (typically a mark) and pick (or type the name of) an anchor in the combo box. The selected component will be reanchored to the new anchor.

If you keep the combo box empty, the component will be unanchored.

Click the *Propagate* button to apply the component and anchoring structure of the current master to all other masters of the active glyph.

### Installation

1. Open *Window > Plugin Manager*
2. Find *Anchor Components* and click the *Install* button
3. Restart Glyphs.app
